# SimpleRestApiSimulator

A beginner-friendly simulation of a REST API using C# without ASP.NET or .NET CLI. This project demonstrates basic backend logic such as routing, HTTP-like actions, and CRUD operations in a console-based application.

## 💡 Why This Project?

I built this project to simulate how REST APIs work behind the scenes — without relying on ASP.NET or the `dotnet` CLI (which I currently cannot use). This helps me deeply understand MVC architecture, routing logic, and controller/service design.
